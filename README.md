# Diwali-Sales-Analysis-using-python
For the analysis of the diwali sales dataset, I have leveraged data cleaning, manipulation, and EDA using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to identify the key customer segments.
I have identified key customer demographics (state, occupation, gender, age, etc.) for targeted customer experience strategies.
For the proper analysis of the dataset, I was required to load the CSV file into to Python (Jupyter Notebook) and clean and extract the useable data. For this process I used Pandas to manipulate the dataset and derive the usuable data from the dataset.
Once I was successfully able to derive the required dataset I used Matplolib and Seaborn functions to represent the dataset graphically based on certain parameters. This helped to understand the insights of the datasets efficiently with ease.
